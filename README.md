## Overview

This project was born from my need to simplify WordPress page creation. Bricks Builder is my favorite page builder because it's the one that most closely aligns with my developer mindset.

### The Vision

My goal is to be able to give an AI code tool an image of a website template, and have it reproduce it as faithfully as possible using Bricks components. However, I don't want the AI to style every single component individually‚ÄîI want it to think like a frontend developer would:

- **Layout management** - Structure the page hierarchy properly
- **Site color palette** - Define and use global colors
- **Typography system** - Set up consistent typography rules
- **Template structure** - Create reusable templates
- **And more...**

Only at the end, using the components, templates, and global styles, should it build the actual page elements.

Maybe this project already exists and I haven't been able to find it, or maybe it will become something bigger than my capabilities‚Äîbut this is my goal.

**If anyone wants to join this journey with suggestions, help, or insights, you're very welcome!**
